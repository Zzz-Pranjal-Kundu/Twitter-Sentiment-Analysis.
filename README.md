# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis.
This Twitter sentiment analysis project involves collecting tweets related to a specific topic by web scraping, using natural language processing techniques we analyze and classify sentiments (positive, negative, neutral), and presenting insights through visualizations.

Pre-requisites:
  * google chrome must be up-to-date.
  * install chrome driver on desktop.
  * Twitter(X) account to scrape Tweets.
  * install all the required libraries(eg.: matplotlib, seaborn, nltk, langdetect etc.)

This Project makes the use of the concept of web scraping to scrape of tweets from Twitter(now known as X) based on the user entered topics.
It further creates a pandas Dataframe using those tweets and by applying various methods, the tweets are cleaned and filtered.
Using nltk module sentiment analysis of the gathered tweets is carried out and the result is thus visualized.
